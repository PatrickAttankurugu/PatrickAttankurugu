<h4>
 <P>Patrick Attankurugu is a level 300 Computer Science student at the University of Ghana. I am a book lover. I read wide into areas such as mathematics,programming,business,christianity and the meaning of life. I also read deep in the area of Data Science and machine learning-specifically how to build intelligent systems with data.Over the past year, I have worked either alone or with other people to build scientific calculators, geodemographic segmentation models,and deep learning models. In the past month, I worked with a team of 4 to build a systems that predicts the presence of malaria parasites in microscopic blood smear images. In the month of November, I am working on an open source project-to build an ecommerce platform for entrepreneurs to simply clone and modify to suit their taste. When this project is completed, developer entrepreneurs will not have to go through the hassle of building an ecommerce platform from scratch. Just clone and modify. You are welcome to contribute to this project.You can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickattankurugu1/">Chat Me Up</a> on LinkedIn</P>
