## Overview

I deploy production ML systems for financial regulatory compliance. At **Agregar Technologies**, I architect AI-driven platforms for identity verification, fraud detection, and KYC/AML compliance—building systems that are accurate, explainable, and scalable.

**Specialization:** MLOps infrastructure for financial services where regulatory compliance, model explainability, and production reliability are critical.

## Experience

**Senior AI/ML & Backend Engineer** | Agregar Technologies

- Architected production KYC/KYB risk engine with real-time verification, model monitoring, drift detection, and automated retraining
- Deployed deepfake detection system achieving 99.7% accuracy, protecting identity verification workflows from synthetic media attacks
- Built MLOps infrastructure with CI/CD pipelines, A/B testing, and monitoring dashboards using MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes
- Designed fraud prevention systems processing high-volume transactions with sub-100ms latency

**Impact:** Reduced false positive rates by 40% while maintaining 99%+ accuracy.

**Co-founder & Technical Lead** | SEMA Technologies  
Led distributed AI surveillance platform for real-time threat detection across multiple security installations.
